Nice to meet you, and welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋🏼
I graduated from Northeastern University in May 2025 with a degree in economics and political science, and a minor in data science. 🎓
I'm interested in domestic and international politics, applied economics, and public policy. I believe that the key to building a smarter, fairer, kinder, and better society is in leveraging technology - and data in particular - to find solutions to complicated problems. 💡
